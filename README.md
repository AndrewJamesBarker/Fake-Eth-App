# 💪 Web3 Fake ETH Sender (React + Vite + Hardhat)

This is a local-only web3 sandbox project for simulating Ethereum transactions without needing real wallets or testnets. Built with Vite + React on the frontend and a local Hardhat node simulating the blockchain backend.

Fake ETH is sent between generated Hardhat accounts, using `ethers.js` to sign and broadcast transactions.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Connects to a local Hardhat blockchain (`http://127.0.0.1:8545`)
* Sends fake ETH from a wallet created with a Hardhat private key
* Displays transaction hash after successful transfer
* Modular UI components (Atomic Design structure: atoms, molecules, organisms)
* Fully local — no testnets or real wallets required

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + React
* [Ethers.js v5](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/)
* [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
* [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) component structure

## 🧪 How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone and install frontend:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/web3-fake-eth.git
cd web3-fake-eth
npm install
```

### 2. Start the frontend dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. In a separate terminal, set up Hardhat:

```bash
cd ..
mkdir eth-hardhat
cd eth-hardhat
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat
```

Choose:

* "Create a basic sample project"
* Install dependencies when prompted

Start the blockchain:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

Keep this running. It spins up 20 fake ETH-rich accounts at `http://127.0.0.1:8545`.

### 4. Update `ethUtils.js` in the React app:

Paste in one of the **private keys** from Hardhat output to act as the sender.

Use any **other** account address in the UI to act as the recipient.

## ✍️ Example Transaction

```plaintext
From: 0x8626f6940e2eb28930efb4cef49b2d1f2c9c1199
To:   0xdd2fd4581271e230360230f9337d5c0430bf44c0
Amount: 0.1 ETH
Gas: 21000
```

## 🌱 Future Expansion Ideas

Here are some directions this sandbox could go next:

* 🔐 **Web3Auth-style login simulation** (select wallets from UI)
* 📊 **Display account balances before/after tx**
* 📜 **Add a smart contract** (e.g., counter or NFT minting demo)
* 🌍 **Deploy to testnet (optional)** using Alchemy/Infura + MetaMask
* 🛠️ **More UI components** (cards, transaction history, status indicators)
* 🧪 **Unit tests for ethUtils.js and components**
* 🔬 **Storybook setup** for Atomic component previews

---

## ✅ Security Note

This project is for **local testing only**. The private keys shown in `ethUtils.js` are generated by Hardhat and have **no value or risk**. They are safe to share, commit, or hard-code during local development.
